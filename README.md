# ML Learning Journal

This repository is a **learning journal and practice space for Machine Learning**.  
I am just starting, so it will gradually include notebooks, scripts, datasets, and analyses as I learn and practice.

## Repository Structure (planned)

- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks with experiments and examples
- `scripts/` → Python scripts and utility functions
- `datasets/` → Datasets used or links to them
- `models/` → Trained models
- `reports/` → Analyses and visualizations

## Technologies and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook
